Before joining the Awadalla lab in January 2020, I completed my HBSc in Pharmacology at UBC. My undergraduate research focused on (i) building computational tools to study the genetics of adverse drug reactions in pediatric cancer patients and (ii) investigating genome evolution and pleiotropy in plant model organisms. My PhD research expands on my interests in both cancer and evolution where I am focused on building simulation-based and machine learning tools to analyze evolution in non-recombining systems, particularly tumours and somatic tissues. As well, I am highly interested in the interplay between rapid adaptation and drug resistance.
