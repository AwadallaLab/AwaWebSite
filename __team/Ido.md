Prior to joining the Awadalla lab in 2020, I completed my BMSc in Microbiology and Immunology with Pathology at the University of Western Ontario. 
Throughout my studies I am particularly interested in studying single cell transcriptomics in the context of cancer and the immune system. Specifically I aim to develop tools for automatic cellular classification methodsto both understand the underlying biology of tumour heterogeniety and the associated clinical implications. I am co-supervised at the OICR with Dr. Sagi Abelson.
