Before joining the Awadalla lab in January 2019, I completed my BSc in genome biology and statistics as well as an MSc in evolutionary genetics at the University of Toronto. My masterâ€™s thesis examined the effect of transposable elements on gene expression across the genome in a population of flowering plants. In the Awadalla lab, I will provide bioinformatics support to graduate students and I hope to improve my bioinformatics and data analysis skills working with large datasets.
