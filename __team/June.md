Before joining the Awadalla lab in 2023, I completed my BSc in Systems and Information Biology at Concordia University in Montreal. I'm fascinated by the evolution of heterogeneous cell populations, especially in the context of cancer, and how somatic mutations contribute to health outcomes and treatment effectiveness in the framework of precision medicine. My research focuses on using statistical and machine learning tools to investigate the factors underlying the process of healthy aging in multi-omic and high-dimensional immune data.
