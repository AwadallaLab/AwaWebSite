Prior to joining the Awadalla lab, I completed my BSc in biology at Queenâ€™s University. My honours thesis used a next-generation sequencing method to assess population structure of polar bears in the Canadian Arctic, in order to understand how the changing environment is influencing the species. In September 2018, I joined the department of Molecular Genetics at the University of Toronto, completing a rotation in the Awadalla lab at that time. I officially started my MSc research in the lab in January 2019. I have a strong interest in population genomics and hope to use these approaches to understand aspects of cancer development across the Canadian population.
