I completed a PhD at McGill University in population genetics and developmental biology. I then joined the group of Dr. Philip Awadalla at the CHU Sainte-Justine for a postdoctoral fellowship. I applied bioinformatics and statistical genetics approaches to multi-omics data from the CARTaGENE cohort to discover how the environmental exposures modulate gene expression profiles and influence disease risk in the Québec population. I then moved along the Awadalla group at the Ontario Institute for Cancer Research and Vector Institute for Artificial Intelligence where I'm currently focusing on applying bioinformatics, machine learning and deep learning approaches to multi-omics datasets from large population and cancer biobanks.
