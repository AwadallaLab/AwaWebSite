Prior to joining the Awadalla lab, I did my undergraduate studies at McGill University in 2019, where I earned my Bachelor of Science in Life Sciences with a minor in Computer Science. My passion for both fields stems from my interest in understanding complex biological systems and using computational methods to analyze and interpret the data. Then I joined the department of Molecular Genetics at the University of Toronto in 2022. My research interests lie in the field of cancer research, specifically in the integration of multiomics data to gain a comprehensive understanding of the underlying biology of the disease.
