Before joining the Awadalla lab in 2024, I completed my HBSc in Biochemistry and Immunology at the University of Toronto, and I am currently an MD/PhD student at the Temerty Faculty of Medicine. My research interests lie in the mutational dynamics underlying hematological malignancies and the genetic basis of clonal hematopoiesis. I aim to use multi-omics data to analyze the evolutionary processes and population dynamics driving age-related clonal hematopoiesis specifically within the context of chronic inflammation. I am also interested in deciphering the impact of the exposome on the clonal diversity and accumulation of somatic mutations in the blood cell pool.
