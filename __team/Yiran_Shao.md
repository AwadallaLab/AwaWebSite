I'm a Master's student in the Department of Molecular Genetics who joined the Awadalla Lab in 2022. I received my HBSc in Biology and Computer Science from Western University in 2022. I'm interested in the intersection between statistics, machine learning, and pathology, specifically on developing machine learning algorithms for automating biological data analysis. Currently, I'm working on developing machine learning tools to understand the relationship between cancer cell morphology and genotype. That being said, I'm also interested in many other aspects in under the general umbrella of biology and data science... still testing the waters to find where my core bioinformatical interests lie!
