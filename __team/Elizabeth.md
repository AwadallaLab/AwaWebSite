Prior to joining the Awadalla Lab, I completed my HBSc with a specialist in Health and Disease and a major in Molecular Genetics at the University of Toronto (U of T). In January 2020, I joined the Awadalla Lab as a graduate student through the Department of Molecular Genetics at U of T. My research is focused on innovating on and applying polygenic risk models in hopes of disentangling genotype-phenotype associations for complex human diseases across the Canadian population.
