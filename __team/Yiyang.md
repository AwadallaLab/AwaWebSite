I joined the Awadalla Lab in January 2024, after completing my BSc with a specialization in Pathobiology and a minor in Statistics at the University of Toronto. My research is primarily focused on integrating genomic and epigenomic data to enhance the early detection of cancer. This involves the use of nanopore sequencing of liquid biopsies to identify cancer markers and signatures through cell-free DNA profiling. Additionally, I am investigating the application of this methodology for the real-time identification of cancer subtypes. I am co-supervisor by Dr. Jared Simpson at the OICR.
